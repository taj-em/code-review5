# _Code Review 5_

#### By _**Taj Empey**_

#### _Capable of calculating your equivalent age in years for all planets in the solar system to the 2nd decimal._

## Technologies Used

- _JavaScript_
- _WebPack_
- _Jest_
- _ESlint_
- _Babel_

## Description

_Will take three numbers, will tell how old you are on a given planet at the moment, as well as the time that will pass, and has passed, until or since the specified number of years._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

- _Open calc.js and press CTRL + A to select all_
- _Press CTRL + C to copy the selected code_
- _Open Google Chrome_
- _Open the devtools console by pressing CTRL + SHIFT + I_
- _Press CTRL + V to paste the copied code into the console_
- _Before hitting Enter; remove the export tag from the UserInput() constructor on line 1_
- _Press Enter_
- _Create a new UserInput() object with "const ages = new UserInput(age1, age2,age3);_
- _age1 represents your current age, age2 represents an age in the future and age3 represents an age in the past_
- _call ages.getCurrentAge(); to receive your current age in years throughout the solar system_
- _call ages.getYearsUntil(); to receive the gap between your selected future age and your current age in years throughout the solar system_
- _call ages.getYearSince(); to receive the gap between your selected past age and your current age in years throughout the solar system_

- _Will throw an error if "export" is included when confirming the code within the devtools console_
